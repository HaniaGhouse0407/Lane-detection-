##Lane Detection using OpenCV

This project demonstrates a simple lane detection algorithm using OpenCV library. The algorithm processes video footage or image frames and identifies the lane markings on the road, providing a visualization of the detected lanes.

## Features

- **Lane Detection**: The program analyzes each frame of a video or an image and detects the lane markings on the road.
- **Lane Visualization**: The detected lanes are overlaid on the original video or image, providing a visual representation of the detected lanes.
- **Real-time Lane Detection**: The algorithm can process video footage in real-time, allowing for live lane detection.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV 4.x
